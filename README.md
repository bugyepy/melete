# Melete SF Species Generator

This project generates simple science fiction species profiles based on a
bitmask of abilities and environmental parameters.

A small Streamlit app displays random species for a randomly selected
environment. Run it with:

```bash
streamlit run -m sfgen.app
```

Each run shows the environment parameters and up to ten valid ability
bitstrings along with brief text descriptions.
The ability names and environment parameter labels appear in Japanese in the UI.
