# Melete SF Species Generator

This project generates simple science fiction species profiles based on a
bitmask of abilities and environmental parameters.

A small Streamlit app displays random species for a randomly selected
environment. Run it with:

```bash
streamlit run -m sfgen.app
```

Each run shows the environment parameters and up to ten valid ability
bitstrings along with brief text descriptions.
